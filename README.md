# Air Quality Analysis Project

This repository contains source code and documentation for a machine-learning-based approach to predict urban air quality using sensor data.

## Contents
- **documentation.md**: Detailed guide on data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
- **Data** folder: Contains air quality datasets and any relevant metadata.
- **Models** folder: Stores scripts and saved models used for prediction (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Notebooks** (if any): Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data analysis and modeling steps.

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.8+ and required libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, xgboost, pandas).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. (Optional) Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for interactive exploration.

## Usage
1. Run preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the dataset.  
2. Execute the model training scripts in the **Models** folder or the notebooks for a step-by-step demonstration.
3. Evaluate results and check visualizations to understand model performance.

## Future Work
- Integrate advanced deep learning approaches (LSTM networks) for improved temporal modeling.
- Apply transfer learning techniques for cross-location analysis of sensor data.
- Explore causal inference methods to better identify and quantify pollution drivers.
